# Contributing

Have a question? File an [issue](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune/issues) to discuss with all our contributors. 

We encourage anyone to file [pull requests](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune/pulls) to fix/improve/create new documentation. Before doing so, have a look at the open issues to see if there is any discussion on the topic.

## Markdown format

We follow the [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) style. Avoid adding html - or any other presentational logic. We are currently investigating the best way to embed Figma component design previews. To create or modify tables we recommend using [tables generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) as it keeps our tables human-readable in raw text.
